# Machine-Learning-Practice
A repository for me to start practicing and learning

I am going to use and probably work on notebooks that I would have linked to google colaboratory. Will follow tutorials given by CodeBasics Youtube channel.
Maybe do some random projects on my own just to try it out. 
Main rule should be to comment on everything you have here. Don't do some shitass job of not commenting and stuff.
